# 👋 About Me

<p style="text-indent: 1em;">
Hi, I am currently pursuing a PhD at the State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence System, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huweiming">Weiming Hu</a>, Prof. <a href="https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~bingli">Bing Li</a>, Prof. <a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuanchunfeng">Chunfeng Yuan</a> and Associate Prof. <a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wangjuan">Juan Wang</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1e m;">
Before that, I got my bachelor’s degree from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU) in 2022. Especially thank Prof. <a href="https://rmcong.github.io/MVPLab.html">Runming Cong</a> and Prof. <a href="https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/rjxy/773.html">Fangshi Wang</a> for their guidance during this period.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1em;">
I'd like to solve practical challenges motivated by real-world industrial problems, and have published some papers at the top international venues (ECCV, CVPR, IJCV, etc.) <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ozllxV4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

My research interests include:
</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-camera fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Computational Imaging</p>
- Image Quality Assessment (IQA)
- Image Signal Processing (ISP)
- 3A Algorithms
- AI-ISP

<p><i class="fas fa-layer-group fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Multimodal Understanding</p>
- Vision-Language Models (VLM)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

<p style="text-indent: 1em;">
Recently, my research focuses on developing a <strong>unified foundational model for IQA</strong> that can support multiple IQA tasks, such as quality prediction and distortion localization. In parallel, I am also working on an <strong>AI-driven pet companion project 🐾</strong> that helps pet owners curate warm, lasting memories and better meet their genuine companionship needs. I would be pleased to connect with anyone who shares interests in these directions.
